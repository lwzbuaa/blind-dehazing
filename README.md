This is an implementation of single image dehazing algorithms. We attempt to implement two papers, the ICCP '16 [paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7492870/) "Blind dehazing using internal patch recurrence", by Yuval Bahat & Michal Irani, and the CVPR '09 [paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567108) "Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior" by Kaiming He, Jian Sun, and Xiaoou Tang.
