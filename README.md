This is an implementation of single image dehazing algorithms. We attempt to implement two papers, the ICCP '16 paper "Blind dehazing using internal patch recurrence", by Yuval Bahat & Michal Irani. Find the paper [here](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7492870/) and CVPR '09 paper "Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior" by Kaiming He, Jian Sun, and Xiaoou Tang.
